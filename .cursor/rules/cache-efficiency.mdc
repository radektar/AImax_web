- **One-task-per-thread**: Start a new chat per task or pull request. Avoid mixing topics to prevent large historical contexts from being re-read.
- **Be explicit and scoped**: Reference exact files and lines instead of broad requests.
  - Good: "Edit `app/layout.tsx`, update header link."
  - Avoid: "Scan the repo and fix all issues."
- **Minimal pasting**: Instead of pasting large code blocks, reference files or lines.
- **Bounded context searches**: Limit searches to specific directories or files.
- **Small-by-default model policy**: Use smaller models for general tasks; reserve larger models for complex tasks.
- **Lean pinned rules**: Keep pinned rules concise and reference detailed documentation elsewhere.
- **Monitor usage**: Regularly check the Cursor dashboard to identify threads or patterns with high cache reads and adjust accordingly.
- **Team hygiene**: Keep large files (logs, assets) out of chats; store them in the repository and reference by path instead.
