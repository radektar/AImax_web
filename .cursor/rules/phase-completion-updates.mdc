# Phase Completion Rule - Update Project Context

## When to Apply This Rule
Apply this rule whenever completing any of the 5 development phases outlined in PROJECT_SCOPE.md:
- Phase 1: Template Setup & Cleanup
- Phase 2: Content Structure Implementation  
- Phase 3: Branding & Styling
- Phase 4: Content Integration
- Phase 5: Optimization & Deployment

## Required Actions After Phase Completion

### 1. Review Current Phase Status
- Verify all phase deliverables are completed
- Document any deviations from original plan
- Note any additional features or changes implemented

### 2. Update PROJECT_SCOPE.md
Always update [PROJECT_SCOPE.md](mdc:PROJECT_SCOPE.md) to reflect:
- **Completed Phase:** Mark which phase was just finished
- **Current Status:** Update development guidelines with current state
- **Active Constraints:** Remove completed items, add new considerations
- **Next Phase Focus:** Highlight upcoming phase requirements

### 3. Update Development Phases Section
Modify the "Development Phases" section in PROJECT_SCOPE.md to include:
- Completed phase checkmark
- Current active phase
- Any new technical decisions or constraints discovered
- Updated file structure or component locations

### 4. Update Timeline and Status Sections
Update relevant sections in PROJECT_SCOPE.md with:
- New compliance requirements discovered
- Updated branding decisions made
- Technical constraints identified during the phase
- User feedback or requirement changes

## Example Update Pattern
```markdown
### Phase 1: Template Setup & Cleanup ✅ COMPLETED
1. ✅ Clone Next.js SaaS Starter template
2. ✅ Remove unnecessary features (Stripe, pricing, complex dashboards)
3. ✅ Set up basic project structure
4. ✅ Configure development environment

**Status:** Completed on [DATE] - All deliverables achieved, build and development environment working.
```

## Commit Message Format
When updating PROJECT_SCOPE.md after phase completion, use commit format:
"Update PROJECT_SCOPE.md after Phase [X] completion - [brief description]"

## Documentation Requirements
- Always reference the completed phase deliverables
- Document any technical debt or future considerations discovered
- Update timeline estimates if phases took longer/shorter than expected
- Note any scope changes or requirement clarifications

This ensures the project context rule stays current and provides accurate guidance throughout the development lifecycle.
