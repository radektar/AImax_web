# Phase Completion Rule - Update Project Context

## When to Apply This Rule
Apply this rule whenever completing any of the 5 development phases outlined in PROJECT_SCOPE.md:
- Phase 1: Template Setup & Cleanup
- Phase 2: Content Structure Implementation  
- Phase 3: Branding & Styling
- Phase 4: Content Integration
- Phase 5: Optimization & Deployment

## Required Actions After Phase Completion

### 1. Review Current Phase Status
- Verify all phase deliverables are completed
- Document any deviations from original plan
- Note any additional features or changes implemented

### 2. Update project-scope-context.mdc
Always update [project-scope-context.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/project-scope-context.mdc) to reflect:
- **Completed Phase:** Mark which phase was just finished
- **Current Status:** Update development guidelines with current state
- **Active Constraints:** Remove completed items, add new considerations
- **Next Phase Focus:** Highlight upcoming phase requirements

### 3. Update Development Guidelines Section
Modify the "Development Guidelines" section in project-scope-context.mdc to include:
- Completed phase checkmark
- Current active phase
- Any new technical decisions or constraints discovered
- Updated file structure or component locations

### 4. Review Always Consider Section  
Update the "Always Consider" section with:
- New compliance requirements discovered
- Updated branding decisions made
- Technical constraints identified during the phase
- User feedback or requirement changes

## Example Update Pattern
```markdown
## Development Guidelines:
1. ✅ Follow the phased development approach outlined in PROJECT_SCOPE.md
2. ✅ Phase 1 Complete: Template Setup & Cleanup (Completed: [DATE])
3. 🔄 Phase 2 Active: Content Structure Implementation  
4. Maintain healthcare-appropriate professional tone and design
5. Focus on the three core value propositions: Easy to use, Empathetic & friendly, Reliable
```

## Commit Message Format
When updating project-scope-context.mdc after phase completion, use commit format:
"Update project context after Phase [X] completion - [brief description]"

## Documentation Requirements
- Always reference the completed phase deliverables
- Document any technical debt or future considerations discovered
- Update timeline estimates if phases took longer/shorter than expected
- Note any scope changes or requirement clarifications

This ensures the project context rule stays current and provides accurate guidance throughout the development lifecycle.
